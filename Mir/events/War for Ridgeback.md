# War for Ridgeback

Started: #TBC/date
Ended: #TBC/date 

## Overview
Growing up, [[Jayson Hornehill]], lord to-be of [[Ashvale (Region)|Ashvale]] felt disdain towards the other lords of the land. They jostled for power, and were dismissive of [[Leyla Hornehill]], Jayson's mother. The fighting continued until Jayson became lord, and he seized upon the opportunity to teach these other lords a lesson.

There was general discontent with Leyla Hornehill from many other lords throughout [[Ridgeback]]. This included [[Earn Proctor]], the lord of [[Hilland]], [[Krikor AÃ³me]], lord of [[Wetlands|The Wetlands]], [[Morven Stiggard]], lord of [[Estearth]], and [[Ari Halack]], lord of [[Frosthelm]].
			
The lords of the northern regions, Frosthelm and The Snow Plains, saw the war as an opportunity to raise their greavances, as they see themselves as slighted and ignored by the other, warmer regions of Ridgeback. The lord of Hilland saw Leyla as unfit to rule, due to the noble familiy of Hilland's deep-set misogyny. The others were less invested, but saw the war as an opportunity to gain more lands and power.

Together, Jayson of Ashvale, [[Pashja Westshore]] of [[Roke]], and [[Brandon Horlay]] of [[Sand Flats]], managed to defeat the other lords. The less-invested opposing lords surrendered soon after realising the war would not be as one-sided as they planned. The winning regions had the advantage of large swathes of land, with lots of food production and population. The Hornehills were also previously in power, and so had existing infrastructure, including a lot of influence with [[Royal Magicians Guild|The Royal Magicians Guild]].
