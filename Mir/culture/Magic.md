# Magic

## Overview
Some objects are imbued with magical properties or powers. This is uncommon and is usually a result of a tear between the Material and the Abyss. Sometimes these tears occur randomly and "naturally", and sometimes they are created by beings from either plane.

Magical energies can create phonomena that would seem otherwise physically impossible. Energies and matter moving across the planes appear to be created, destroyed or moved instantaneously.

## The Abyss
The material plane and the abyss overlap spacially and temporally. Everything exists in all planes, but not everything is perceivable in all planes, and not everything can perceive all planes.

The abyss is where magical energy resides. Here the movement (rate of change) of energy is visible and tanglible. This includes life energy. A maelstrom of spirits reside in The Abyss. They are difficult to differentiate and it is essentially meaningless to do so.
Occasionally some spirit will attach itself to a physical person, either when they are born, or when some other event of notice to spirits occurs. When the physical body they are attached to dies, the spirit does not; Over time it will dissipate back into the other energies. Not all creatures in the Material plane will be of interest to sprit energies.

Occassionally rifts between the planes will emerge, and energies and matter can travel freely in either direction.

## Magic Users
Some people can use magic to affect the world. These people are very few and far between, and they are feared by almost everyone else. They are, however, very powerful. Which people see as useful. In [[Ridgeback]], there is a [[Royal Magicians Guild|Guild of Magicians]] who are approved by the King, and who perform royal duties.

Some races are more highly tuned to the magical energies, but all are potential hosts. 
[[Midnighter|Midnighters]] are the most highly tuned of the sapient animals of Mir, but some more wild animals have more affinity to the Abyss.
