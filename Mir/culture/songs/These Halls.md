# These Halls
This is a song sung in taverns and village halls. A casual folk song celebrating family, friends, food and simple pleasures of life. Often the last line of the chorus (Ta ra rah) will be replaced with a joke inclusion of someone else, not considered friends or kin, to mock them. This will be in the form 'And ----', including their name. 

## Lyrics
These halls where we sing
Full of friends and kin
(Ta ra rah)

The snow falls
But the hearth is warm
So throw another log on
And we'll outwait this storm
