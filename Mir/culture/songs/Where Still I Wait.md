# Where Still I Wait

## Lyrics
Where my love she goes
There I will go
She's beauty like a rose
And could bloom in the snow

We sat under the horien tree
And watched the world crawl by
Our world her and me
Under the dark'ning sky

*When we part my heart does break
When she stays my days awake*

We sat in pastures green
warm against the cold
But something unseen
Slipped into our fold

And now she wanders far
And I tend the hearth
I pray my shooting star
Will once more cross my path

*When we part my heart does break
When she stays my days awake*

This pain I feel inside
I wish it would abate
??? #TBC
Where still I wait
