# Time To Go
This song was traditionally sung at the end of long voyages, where the sailors could air their complaints with little risk of repercussions. To sing this song earlier at sea was tantamount to, and often a sign of, mutiny.

## Lyrics
With a pull and heave
We're almost there
*Time to go
Land is ho*
The cook in the galley's got nowt left to spare
*And we'll all be home tomorrow*
