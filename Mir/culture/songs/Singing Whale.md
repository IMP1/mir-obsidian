# Singing Whale

See [[Whale Song]].

## Lyrics
Once there sailed a ship
The finest ever were
The *Gliding Swallow* she was called
None so fine as her

The mightiest of crews
The best sailors of us all
Heard the singing whale
As it began to call

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*

The sea it turned them round
And steer as they might
They could get her back
From the clutches of the night

They looked around to see
From whence the singing came
And saw just other ships
Rolling just the same

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*

One by one ships fell
To the stomach of the whale
Last beneath the waves
Was the *Gliding Swallow*'s sail

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*
