# Calendars

## Days
Almost all creatures and people recognise the time it takes from the sunrise to the next sunrise, and are affected by this cycle.

Across Ridgeback, most people split the day into three parts. **Sunrise** is from dawn to the sun's peak, **Sunfall** is from sunpeak to dusk, and **Night** is from dusk to dawn. The advantage of this system is that it requires no time-keeping devices, and the transitions between the phases are apparent to all.

This also results in 6 points of the day, at (roughly) the midpoints of each of these phases, and their transitions. We have **Dawn**, **Midrise**, **Sunpeak**, **Midfall**, **Dusk**, and **Midnight**.

Larger towns and cities uses some kind of time-keeping devices, and sounds out at periods throughout the day.

Also in some regions, days are grouped into 4 to make a week.

In First Morn (back when it was a thing) they also adopted the week, and set aside a day per week (the weekend) for market days and religious worship.

## Lunar Months
It takes the moon approximately 9 and a third days to orbit the planet. Lunar months, due to their irregular nature, have no formalised system for measurement. But often in many places new moons and full moons are cause for celebration or caution.

Every day the moon grows or shrinks just under a quarter of its diameter.

## Solar Years
It takes the planet approximately 134.125 days to orbit its star *(This makes one Mir-Year roughly equal to 0.3765 Earth-years)*. More temperate resions of Mir, like [[Ridgeback]] undergo seasonal changes throughout the year.

Across Ridgeback people also see the year similarly to the day, and split it accordingly into three seasons: **Lenen** is early spring to midsummer, **Feallen** is midsummer to late autumn, and **Wentruth** is the wintertimes. Each of these seasons comprise 44 days, with the remaining two days (or three on a leap year every eight years) are dedicated to celebrating midsummer, known as **Sun's Peak**. There is also **Midlenen**, **Mideallen** (Mid-Feallen), and **Midwentruth**. The day between Feallen and Wentruth is called **Dawain**, and the day between Wentruth and Lenen is called **Dawaxen**.

## Formal Calendars
The formal calendar system of weeks, seasons, midsummer celebrations, and leap years was instigated by [[Lowen Redwing]] shortly into his time as King. His father, [[Pala Redwing]], had had the years tracked, from midsummer to midsummer, counting the days. Lowen decided to break the year up similarly to how people had broken up the day for centuries, which helped widespread adoption. Lowen called this period of time, with this new system of time-keeping, the **Palan Age**.
