## Instruments
### Deid
A three-stringed instrument made of wood. Usually with a short neck coming from a large round body, similar to a real-life baroque mandolin.
There are two popular tunings for the deid. 
The first is is E, B, F#, with the B being the lowest note, making a Esus2, and is usually played in the key of E.
The second is a F minor triad, with the middle Ab actually being up an ocave. This can easily be made into a major triad with just that highest string being played on the first "fret" (although there are no frets - I'm just writing this coming from a background in acoustic guitar)
