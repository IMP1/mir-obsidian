# Technology

## Overview
Across Mir, tools range from simple stone and flint to forged metal. Animals are used as beasts of burden by some societies and species. Food acquisition ranges from agriculture and intensive farming to nomadic foraging.

Sometimes, magic has made certain technologies available where they would otherwise not be. #TBC
