## Overview
Rissar is a famed explorer and sailor. Born in [[Kingsooth (Region)|Kingsooth]], he left home younger than most, and joined a travelling performance troupe. They taught him useful life skills in return for his magical prowess and ability to wonder. He yearned, however, for distant shores and the unknown, and he left them to join various sailing companies throughout his years.

Rissar was hired by [[Jayson Hornehill]] to explore [[The Sisters]]. He was to search for a fabled item of power, the [[Truth Stone]].
