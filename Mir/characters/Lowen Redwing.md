## Overview
Lowen Redwing was raised in [[Bradcombe]], the capital of [[Roke]], to a life of relative luxury. He was a slight child and, as he grew up, he grew to love scholarly activities, and spend less time on physical training, with which his father, [[Pala Redwing]], was a little dissapointed. Nevertheless, he became a wise ruler, knowing when to listen to advice, and when to be decisive. He struggled to be seen as strong, but had good diplomatic relations with the other regions of [[Ridgeback]], and so it mattered little.

## Royalty
Pala, Lowen's father, lived to an old age. Before he died, when he was 102, he stepped down as king. Lowen, then 44, took his place in the year 101.

## Behind the Scenes
### Name Etymology
Lowen: Lowen is derived from rowan, the name of the tree.
Redwing: A redwing is a bird that nests in rowan trees.
