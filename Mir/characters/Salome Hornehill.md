## Life
### Childhood
Salome's childhood was incredibly lavish. Her parents assumed they were caring but were by-and-large detached. As she aged, she learnt to understand her place and the feelings people had towards her family and her. Seen as from a pompous and frivolous lot, she tried her best to act grounded and straightforward. She also feels duty-bound to help her people, from her position of power and responsibility. She has always had protection around her, and once found it annoying, but increasingly has grown pragmatic and accepted the company and acknowledged the limited safety. 

### Family
Parents: [[Jayson Hornehill]] and [[Reyah Hornehill]]
Siblings: ???

## Behind the Scenes
