## Overview
Pajha Westshor always had a way with words. She could hide layers of meaning in any sentence she said, and spin goodwill from almost anyone with careful choice of what she said.

Her appearance was the very escense of nondescript. She could blend in at any noble plainswalker setting. She was a cunning woman, and was very interested in the dealings of politicians and lords. She and her husband, who married in to the Westshors from a wealthy family, were good friends with the [[Family#Hornehill|Hornehills]].
