## Overview
Pala Redwing was born in [[Bradcombe]], the capital of [[Roke]], but spent most of his childhood in [[Winwick]], in [[Sand Flats]], living with the lords there, until returning to Bradcombe to become king.

As a child in Winwick, Pala was exposed to many believers of the [[Clarity]] faith, and absorbed a fascination with the natural world, and a general distrust of mages and magic.

Pala lived a long life, stepping down from his royal duties when they became too demanding and encouraged his son, [[Lowen Redwing|Lowen]] to step up and take the crown.

## Royalty
Pala became king of [[Ridgeback]] when his father died at the age of 108, in the year 53.
