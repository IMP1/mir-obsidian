## Overview
Bramble was born in [[Sunshade]], to a single-mother living with her family, living comfortably. Unfortunately, Bramble's mother died in childbirth, and so she was left in the care of her maternal uncle. Not knowing what to do, he took Bramble to the chapel of [[Clarity]], and left her in their care.
