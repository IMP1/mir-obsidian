## Overview
A travelling builder.
Has a cart that he lives in, pulled by two [[Osa]], that he developed into a home on wheels. While this was not altogether uncommon, the internals of the cart were a particular balance of ornate and functional for the size of it, relative to what else was happening at the time.

He had an extensive knowledge of building materials (usually wood) used throughout [[Rijbak]], and would build functional beautiful (subjective, obviously) structures for communities.
