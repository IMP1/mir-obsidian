## Life
### Childhood
Born in the city of [[Ashvael (City)|Ashvale]] to [[Jay ???]] and [[Leyla Hornhil]], Jayson was the second child, eventually of four.

Jayson grew up in uncertain times. There were those who thought that his mother was not fit to be lord of [[Ashvael (Region)|Ashvale]], and some of the other lords across [[Rijbak]] saw this uncertainty as an opportunity to widen their lands. Jayson was mostly sheltered from the impact of the political climate , but an implicit resentment of the other lords was planted in him from a young age.

Jayson found himself sensitive to insults, a trait he shared with his father, and would often overreact to percieved slights to his honour. He grew to be a large child, and was trained in combat. This gave him an assurance in his might that paired dangerously eith his thin skin.
