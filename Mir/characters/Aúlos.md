## Overview
Originally born in [[Waildwcd]], Aúlos's family sent her to [[Standon]] after some early uncontrollable magical outburtsts made the other families living nearby uncomfortable. They thought that she might find someone who might teach her to control her magics. From there she became an initiate of the [[Royal Magicians Guild]]. After some time they then were sent to [[Koldwcd]] to learn from a magician there.

Living in Coldwood, Aúlos is training under [[Vikos]], the Royal Magicians Guild representative there.
Upon moving there, they made friends with [[Emer]], a hunter in the town.
