## Overview
Lily Proctor is the Lady of [[Hilland]], born to [[Earn Proctor]] and [[???]].

Lily was born into a culture that believed that women should not be king. During her childhood, [[Leyla Hornehill]] was lord of [[Ashvale (Region)|Ashvale]], and Lily's family was adamant that it was a man's job to rule. They sowed seeds of doubt in Leyla Hornehill, and used the widespread uncertainty to claim some lands from 
[[Roke]], who were allied with Ashvale.

Lily internalised a distrust of the Hornehills, but resolved herself to prove her family wrong, and be a strong and wise leader. During the [[War for Ridgeback]], when [[Jayson Hornehill]] took control of [[Estearth]], and Roke took back their lands from Hilland, and Jayson declared himself King, Lily submitted her lands, but vowed revenge. She saw Ashvale's conquest as injust, and knew that it was her duty to liberate her lands from Ashvale.

## Behind the Scenes
