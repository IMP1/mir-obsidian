## Overview
Lilii Proktor is the Lady of [[Hiland]], born to [[Ern Proctor]] and [[???]].

Lilii was born into a culture that believed that women should not be king. During her childhood, [[Leyla Hornhil]] was lord of [[Ashvael (Region)|Ashvael]], and Lily's family was adamant that it was a man's job to rule. They sowed seeds of doubt in [[Leyla Hornhil]], and used the widespread uncertainty to claim some lands from 
[[Rook]], who were allied with Ashvael.

Lilii internalised a distrust of the Hornhils, but resolved herself to prove her family wrong, and be a strong and wise leader. During the [[War for Rijbak]], when [[Jayson Hornhil]] took control of [[Esterth]], and Roke took back their lands from Hilland, and Jayson declared himself King, Lily submitted her lands, but vowed revenge. She saw Ashvael's conquest as injust, and knew that it was her duty to liberate her lands from Ashvael.

## Behind the Scenes
