## Gazing Too Long
A mother is seeking help for her children, who are having flashes of vision into the abyss. The children are distressed because what they're seeing is so chaotic and also because nobody else is reacting (because nobody else can see it). Neither the children nor the mother know what is happening. There is no solution, really. There isn't always. The party can try and persuade the mother to let the children die. The party can also just leave and do nothing. There's no real right answer here.

The mother's intent is to have her children be healthy again. She has no approach.
