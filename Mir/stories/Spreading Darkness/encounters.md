## Not Unscathed
[[Kari]], a self-acclaimed hero from the nearby small village [[Westweit]], managed to escape the forest and is shaken from what she saw there.

Her intent is to recover her wits and feel safe again.
Her approach is to not think about the horrors she saw (her fellow hero devoured by the darkness) and heard (their screams as they were consumed).

## A Light in the Dark
Will-o'-the-Wisps are trying to lead anyone astray and consume them. They do this with their lights, tempting people to follow the lights until they find an otherwise dark spot, extinguish their light, and then go in for the attack.

There are also other groups in the forest with lights, so it's not immediately clear what light is what.

## Like a Dwarf Possessed
Some local dwarves have been possessed. They don't really have weapons, and will use what is available to them: sticks, hands and mouths. They are not fighters, and are weak.

On every hit they sustain they roll checks to see if they snap out of their possession. If they do, then they can plead for the players to spare them, explaining their situation. If they don't then I guess it sucks for them and they'll either die or be incapacitated by the players.

## Gebbeth
A shadow attacks one of the party, intending to suck out their lifeforce. Its goal is to consume the lifeforce of anyone, and spread into more shadows. Its approach is to attack anyone coming close enough.

## Guardians
Sprites mistake the party for intruders, mistaking their intentions. If the party has any metal stuff (armour, equipment) then the sprites will be mistrustful. The sprites will either give the party some nice buffs, or some not-nice debuffs.

Their intention is to try to thwart the spread of darkness through the forest. Their approach is to learn more about what this darkness is, and call for help if need be from anyone who will help. Their objection to the party is the (mistaken) belief that the party are intruders and are at best unknown, and at worst on the side of the shadows.

## Not in My Back Yard
A group of Wood Elves are worried about the spreading darkness. They intend to find the cause and destroy it. Their approach to this is find out more about where it has come from, by performing rituals.

## The Pirate King
