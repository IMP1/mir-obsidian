# Spreading Darkness
#dnd/one-shot

## Backstory
Self-proclaimed 'Pirate King' [[Isolde]] had been ravaging the north-eastern seas of [[Rijbak]]. She and her crew sank ships with no mercy. She was the [[Midnighter#Energies & Recharging|source of her own energies]], which left her with little humanity, but great power.

The lords of [[Esterth]], [[Frosthelm]], and [[Kingsccth (Region)|Kingsooth]] all called for the death of Isolde. This was easier said than done, as she could control the winds and the waves, and many who were sent to hunt her were lost. She would go through periods when her body would be filled with magical energies from the [[Magic#The Abyss|void]] and she would be unable to control them.

Eventually a party of mercenaries, many of whom did not survive the encounter, defeated Isolde and her spirit fled towards land. It found a space in the [[Morning Forest|Morning Forest]], and took root, becoming a [[Wraith]], and creating [[Shadow|Shadows]] throughout the woods.

Given Morning Forest saw many visitors and travellers, the Shadows claimed many prey, spreading across the forest, creaing more Shadows. Animals and people alike started to flee the forest.

The lords of Estearth, celebrating Isolde's defeat and her ship's sinking, heard news of these strange developments in the forst, and so sent adventurers to find out the cause of the disturbance. None of these have yet returned.

## Setting
The lord of Estearth, [[Biich Stigard]], has sent for heroes and adventurers, and has sent up camp on the edge of the Morning Forest. He is reluctant to enter the forest himself, but recommends contacting the wood elves.

More local, smaller-time, heroes have ventured in, but not returned, except one, [[Kari]].
