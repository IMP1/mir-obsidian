## Backstory

A disgraced Lord (Lily Proctor) seeks to dethrone the Hornehills. There was an original plan to marry Jason Hornehill and then have him die, leaving her in charge. Unfortunately for Lily, he married someone else and had children. The next plan was concocted by tactical advisors, and some mages. It was to form a friendship with Lord Hornehill, and then to have his children killed off. She would be framed, badly, for their deaths and would "uncover" the framing. She would then be beyond suspicion, and could encourage Jason to go to war with whoever he suspected. While he was at war, she would try to begin to take control of the powerful infrastructures. And when he was at his most distracted she would march on Ashvale and declare herself king.
