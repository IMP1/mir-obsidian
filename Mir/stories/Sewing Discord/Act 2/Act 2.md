# Act 2: Ashore

%% Introduction to interacting with the world and quests %%

## Scene 1: Landed

*Small stones underfoot, rotting flesh, waves crashing against the shore*

The party is beached at [[Dawnstar Bay]]. [[Salome Hornehill|Salome]]'s advisor whips up some healing poultices from nearby herbs. The survivors resolve any remaining issues and set off along the road towards the nearest town. There may be bandits on the road.

## Scene 2: Civilisation

*Wooden houses, ale and stews, hushed whispers*

Players arrive at the village [[Berrywood]] along the road. The villagers are distrusting, as there are bandits around. The party attempts to persuage the village leader to give the party somewhere to sleep. If none can, [[Bramble Hawk|Bramble]] probably will be able to.

There is a travelling entertainment group in the village, and so the inn is full. The party is given some supplies (in exchange for food or services?) and directed to the nearest town with a royal presence.

The party can also investigate around and learn that the village really has a bandit problem, and that, should they help out, they'd be celebrated. Salome is keen to help. The party can maybe intimidate the bandits by trying to say the village is under royal protection? Maybe there are some ties between the bandits and some of the younger members of the village.

If the party don't stick around, and leave right away, they are ambushed by bandits wanting their supplies (and general gear).

Once the party set off in earnest, they have the opportunity to level up and chat to each other and the noble lot.
