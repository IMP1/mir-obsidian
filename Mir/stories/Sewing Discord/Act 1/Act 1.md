# Act 1: Stormy Weather

%% Introduction to the world and the players and the characters %%

## Scene 1: Introduction

*The wind, the salty sea air, yelling and singing of sailors at work*

Starts on a ship (The Singing Whale) going from [[Rooton]] to [[Ashport]]. The ship is carrying cargo and passengers, and its captain is [[Roes Siifarer]]. A noble passenger ([[Salomei Hornhil]]) is being transported with an entourage. The entourage includes an advisor ([[Brambel Hawk]]), a spy ([[Gael Westshor]]), and a knight ([[Orson Karter]]). Salome and her entourage are on their way from Rowton to Ashport. They were in [[Hiland]] to strengthen political alliances, and are returning to [[Ashvael (City)|Ashvale City]].

The crew of has been at sea for a long time, with only short port breaks. The crew includes [[Dris]], who is secretly working for the antagonist. Drys is tasked with killing Salome and making it look like an accident. And then reporting back. Drys decides that doing this near [[Dornstar Bei]] would be best, as she could then report back to [[Riford]]. Its route so far has been [[Kulik]] -> [[Shipdel]] -> [[Rooton]] -> [[Ashport]] -> [[Witmacth]] -> [[Ashport]] #TBC (Check this route)

The players start off in their pre-discussed situations and gradually meet each other and some NPCs.

Also on board is the [[Truth Stone]]. It's being accompanied by [[Risar]], the explorer who found it, and who is returning it to [[Jayson Hornhil]].

## Scene 2: Mutiny

*Drops of rain, darkening clouds, less singing and shouting, but more precise*

The crew is mutinous. They have been at sea for too long and, led by Drys, they are taking control of the ship. Players can take the side of the captain (and Salome et al.) and a small contingent of loyal crew, or the side of Drys the revolting crew. They can then either rescue Salome or take them captive. The storm throws the ship into the rocks. The crew intends to land at Dawnstar Bay and restock from nearby settlements before sailing into the capital.
