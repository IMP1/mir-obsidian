# Act 3: Out of Control

%% Introduction to the trouble Salome is going through %%

## Scene 1: Chaos

*Dirty streets, sweat and testosterone, shouts of fights and trading*

Players arrive to the hubbub of [[Rifford]]. [[Salome Hornehill|Salome]] is excited to be back in contact with her father and let him know she's safe. [[Gael Westshor|Gale]] goes off ahead to scout out the situation.

The streets are full of all sorts of peoples. Bustling markets are making the most of the large numbers of potential customers. There are some guards around, because of the potential for commerce. They try to stop the worst of the fights, but also only weigh in when they can succeed, as a display of force.

There's stuff to buy, that's mostly overpriced and not all that special. There are also thieves and pickpockets about.

Gale finds the party, and tells them that they must hurry to the town hall.

## Scene 2: Bureaucracy

*Clean flagstones and passive faces, cool still air, hushed polite conversation*

[[Rook]], the royal mage for Rifford is busy in a meeting with the town council. She is discussing something unimportant to the party (the problem of expanding the market into another district, where violence has been more rife). She is surprised to find out that Salome is alive (because she was expecting [[Drys]] to return reporting her dead) but tries to not let that show. Salome is eager to contact her father, but Rook delays, saying she must recharge her magical energies. Rook arranges accomodation for the party and tries to keep their contact with anyone to a minimum. She also arranges an assassination that night, trying to keep to the plan of having Salome die at sea, as far as [[Jayson Hornehill|Jayson]] is concerned.
