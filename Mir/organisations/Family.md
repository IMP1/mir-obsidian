# Family
Throughout many species on Mir, family ties are strong. And the powerful seem to tend to cling to power. These two facts combine to form powerful families, accumulating power and keeping it to themselves.
        
Those with members as royalty are obvious candidates as powerful families, but there are others. Lords of smaller domains, who nevertheless command power and have influence.
