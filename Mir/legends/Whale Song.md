# The Whale Song

## Overview
There is a story about a whale whose song drew ships to it, to their demise. There were few survivors, and of those, even fewer were believed.

Over the years, the story dissolved into myths and songs.

## The Singing Whale (Song)

See [[Singing Whale]].

## Whale's Song (Poem)

## The Real Story
This is one of the first [[Cephalopod]] attacks on land-dwelling ships. They convinced one whale to sing, and used it as a beacon. They then used other whales to create waves moving towards the singing whale.

This was to generally discourage ships from sailing across the seas to the east of 
[[Sisters|The Sisters]], which was a preferred route due to prevailing winds.
Cephalopods felt like the ships were encroaching upon their space, scaring off their prey, and polluting the water with their excrement.
