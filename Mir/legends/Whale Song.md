# The Whale Song

## Overview
There is a story about a whale whose song drew ships to it, to their demise. There were few survivors, and of those, even fewer were believed.

Over the years, the story dissolved into myths and songs.

## The Singing Whale (Song)

Once there sailed a ship
The finest ever were
The *Gliding Swallow* she was called
None so fine as her

The mightiest of crews
The best sailors of us all
Heard the singing whale
As it began to call

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*

The sea it turned them round
And steer as they might
They could get her back
From the clutches of the night

They looked around to see
From whence the singing came
And saw just other ships
Rolling just the same

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*

One by one ships fell
To the stomach of the whale
Last beneath the waves
Was the *Gliding Swallow*'s sail

*And the whale it sang
And the ships they rolled
Over into the cold
And fell down down down mast sail
Into the belly of the singing whale*

## Whale's Song (Poem)

## The Real Story
This is one of the first [[Cephalopod]] attacks on land-dwelling ships. They convinced one whale to sing, and used it as a beacon. They then used other whales to create waves moving towards the singing whale.

This was to generally discourage ships from sailing across the seas to the east of 
[[Sisters|The Sisters]], which was a preferred route due to prevailing winds.
Cephalopods felt like the ships were encroaching upon their space, scaring off their prey, and polluting the water with their excrement.
