# Wildwood
#location/ridgeback #location-size/forest

## Overview
Wildwood stretches across a large region of western [[Ridgeback]], including land considered to be part of [[Roke]] and [[Hilland]]. It is populated primarily by [[Plainswalker|Plainswalkers]] who treat the land as common, not owned by anyone. They reject lords' claims to ownership of the land. 

Wildwood's name comes from the way in which the people living within are seen from those who live outside. The people living there are mostly content to be left alone, and so accept the name grudingly if it dissuades people from venturing within.
