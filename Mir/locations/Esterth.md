## Overview
Esterth was subsumed into [[Ashvael (Region)|Ashvael]] in the [[War for Rijbak]]. It remains sparsely inhabited, as its capital, [[Pracdwoq]] (then Ferst Morn) was destroyed.

People still refer to the lands as Esterth, but it is owned and managed by the Lord of Ashvael, and King of [[Rijbak]], [[Jayson Hornhil]].

Before the [[War for Rijbak]], Esterth was governed by [[Morven Stigard]].
