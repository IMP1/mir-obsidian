## Overview
Estearth was subsumed into [[Ashvale (Region)|Ashvale]] in the [[War for Ridgeback]]. It remains sparsely inhabited, as its capital, [[Proudwatch]] (then First Morn) was destroyed.

People still refer to the lands as Estearth, but it is owned and managed by the Lord of Ashvale, and King of [[Ridgeback]], [[Jayson Hornehill]].

Before the War the Ridgeback, Estearth was governed by [[Morven Stiggard]].
