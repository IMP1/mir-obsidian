## Overview
Redcliff is a coastal town in the region of [[Roke]]. It is named for the red cliffs around which it has been built.

It is separated into two main districts, [[Redcliff#High Redcliff|High Redcliff]] and [[Redcliff#Low Redcliff|Low Redcliff]], with a road circling round inland connecting the two.
There are also tunnels in the hill that connect the two districts.

## High Redcliff
High redcliff looks out over the western sea. It is where the majority of the population of Redcliff live. It has a lodging house, and a temple to the [[Worldly Gods]].

## Low Redcliff
Low Redcliff is where the clay from the hills is taken out from the mines and packed onto ships to be taken away and traded.
