## Overview

It is ruled by [[Ari Halak|Ari Halak]].

The lower hills of Frosthelm stretch up to a series of icy peaks. The hills roll across miles of tundra. Few people ever pass through here, preffering to stick to the trails and roads. Animals roam free through these lands, and the edges nearest settlements are hunted for game.
