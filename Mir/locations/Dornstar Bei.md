#location/rijbak/estearth

## Overview
A small bay that has been used for smuggling. It was originally named after [[Dornstar]], a sea captain of the same name known for hunting a whale with a small group of fishing ships. It also known by this name because of its position on the east of the island, where the first stars blink out to welcome in the dawn.

The bay sees little ship traffic, due to the lack of contact with lands to the east, but this and its seclusion and calm waters have led to its popularity with smugglers avoiding the main ports further south. It also allows for good access to the northern fish supplies and large fishing expeditions often either launch from, or rest at, the bay.

The bay is sheltered from icy winds coming form the north by the cliffs ending the east-west mountain range of the island. Its rocky sands reach down into the dark waters, stretching up to the grassy shrubland.
