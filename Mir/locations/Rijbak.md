## Overview
Rijbak is a large continent. Its name (Ridgeback) comes from the [[Hackel|large mountain range]] stretching from north to south.

## Geography
On the western side, the prevailing wind is from the north, and brings cold, wet weather.
On the eastern side, the prevailing wind is from the south, bringing warmer, drier weather.

## Politics
Both eastern and western Rijbak have been separated into regions, owned by lords.
The west has these regions, from north to south:
  - [[Snow Plains]]
  - [[Hiland]]
  - [[Rook]]
  - [[Sand Flats]]

The east has these regions, from north to south:
  - [[Frosthelm]]
  - [[Kingsccth (Region)|Kingsooth]]
  - [[Esterth]]
  - [[Ashvael (Region)|Ashvale]]
  - [[Wetlands]]
  - [[Sand Flats]]

The Sand Flats stretch across both sides, and has coastland on both the east and west of Rijbak.

Despite the lords of Rijbak having carved the land up this way, not everyone sees things the same. There are people in [[Waildwcd]], [[Morning Forest]], [[Miinwcd]], and other large wooded areas who didn't move into larger settlements, and who still see the land as common.
