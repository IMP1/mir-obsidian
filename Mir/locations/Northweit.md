## Overview
Northweit is the largest settlement in the [[Snow Plains]] region, and holds most of the region's population. It serves as a connection between everyone living across the region, and the rest of [[Rijbak]]. Even then, it is a small place, and sees little comings and goings.

## Behind the Scenes
