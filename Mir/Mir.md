## Notes

Hohrintoh word for cake is result-of-baking. And there's some conjoining word like 'of' or '-like' to make something like a chocolate cake or a rice cake.

Hohrintoh: Give the verbs some kind of genres. Maybe transitive and intransitive, or active/passive. It can be the -ar Vs -oh thing. And there can be exceptions because it's meant to be naturalistic

Check out Anglo saxon poetry for inspiration for Mir poetry and songs  
  
Check out oysterband, fairport convention, watersons for folk song inspiration  
  
Write an upbeat folky tune for a tavern  
  
Do flutes have limited notes they can play?  
  
Think about whether this could be incorporated?

Add disabilities that people have.  
Some can be magical  

Add diseases and illnesses people get.
Some can be magical
  
Add professions and think up some notable NPCs belonging to those professions who might be players in the world (or parts of it)

How do (some) animals regulate their temperature? Is this a level of detail I want to incorporate?

## Magic
Mir's Magic system is currently *very* loose. These notes are to try and give it a bit of structure. Currently there has been no effort made to make any of these ideas consistent and all are subject to change.

### Feared but Useful
Some people can use magic to affect the world. These people are very few and far between, and they are feared by almost everyone else. They are, however, very powerful. Which people see as useful. In [[Ridgeback]], there is a [[Royal Magicians Guild|Guild of Magicians]] who are approved by the King, and who perform royal duties.

### Equal Exchange?
Magic can't cool stuff down without raising the temperature of something else (a bit like a fridge). [[Frostberry|Frostberry Plants]] warm the soil around and beneath them to create the cooling effect in their berries. Because the berries are small and concentrated cold-ness, the larger area doesn't need to be warmed to such a degree. In winter this makes patches around the plants where the snow melts, which draws attention to the plants. It also encourages animals seekingt the warmth to the plant who will then eat the berries and distribute the seeds.

### Physical Limitations
Using magic requires physical exertion from the user, like using muscles. So magicians are often in good physical health.
Magic can't send information faster than the speed of light? But maybe glimpses of the future can happen? Uncontrolled? Maybe info *can* be passed faster than the speed of light?

### Real vs Folklore
"Real" magic shouldn't really be called magic. Some people will consider it magic in the same way some people IRL thought things were magic that weren't. Rarely, some practitioners of magic might try to reclaim the word, but magical scholars and academics refer to their practise using metaphor, like weaving, spinning, sailing, etc. 
The word **allworking** is also used (coming from miracle working -> mirrack allworking -> allworking).
But also some people consider it magic, and some people consider other real things (counting, literacy) magic.
Lots of superstition and stuff. But if magic exists, then it wouldn't be called magic then would it. So I guess things that are beyond the scope of allworking are also considered magic.

## Food Webs

### Polar Regions
Garwigar lives in Arctic conditions. They shoot magical fiery missiles at their prey.    
Typically their prey are small mammals, such as XYZ (cute Arctic mouse kinda shovelling things)  
XYZ dig up roots of the hardier plants. Where the plants store their sugars for the snowier months.  
  
### The Wetlands
Redberry trees grow in the marshy wetlands. They release their berries which float along, dispersing their seeds.  
Some herbivorous spiders build webs to catch these berries.  
Some froggy/toady things with long sticky tongues eat the spiders. Kinda waddley, but quick tongue.  
Fish that resemble logs/sticks on top with a tail that grabs their prey. Like a snake, or an eel. Floats along slowly until is landed on.  
  
### Misc
Truorns will chase winklice.  
  
### Forests
Monopards will drop on lone Oginsten.  
Oginsten will coordinate to take down any animal (eg deer). They can communicate animal size, direction, speed, as well as strategies to take it down. These sounds are often 'hidden' within other sounds. Bit like a swarm animal but with sound rather than pheromones.
