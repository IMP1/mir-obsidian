## Overview
Moondeer are a reclusive woodland animal. It is said that its antlers have powerful magical properties. It is also said that the moondeer only shows itself to those it deems worthy. 

The moondeer is very similar to its genetic cousin, **deer**, but is substantially larger and rarer. It has semi-translucent antlers, which has led to the myth of their magical properties as they will sometimes catch the moonlight and shine brightly.
