# Delver

## Overview
Many delvers spend most of their lives underground. Those who venture above ground either prefer darker regions or tend to live nocturnally. This is because, while they prefer the heat, delvers cannot handle the sunlight, as their skin is very succeptible to sun damage. They also struggle to see in high light levels, but can see very well in low light. Delvers also have a sensitivity to electrical charge in and between objects. 

Delvers have very insensitive senses of smell. They can pick out specific smells, such as those that would portend danger deep underground, but other than this, they need a smell to be very strong before they realise it. As such, they can tolerate most foodstuffs, and enjoy very strong-smelling foods.

Delvers can hear with the hairs on their skin. These hairs reacts to pressure variations in the air around it, and their brain can interpret these variations as sound. Sometimes these sounds go straight to their central nervous system, and they will instinctively react to the sounds with no brain processing. This is most often found during cave collapses. 
This also means delvers have no ears. 

## Diet
Delvers would often eat whatever found could be found underground. This would mostly consist of mushrooms and other, smaller, subterranean animals. These include bats, worms, [[Skolatsi|skolatsi]], and sometimes larger cave animals such as bears. Delvers can use their electrical sensitivty to see skolatsi in the darkness.

Some Delvers will also be used to eating semi-cultivated plants from outside their cave. Some cave systems even have pastures outside the cave and animals that some delvers will tend.

## Physique
Delvers typically grow to heights between 1.2m (4') and 1.5m (5'). This is partially due to a lack of nutritional intake in their infancy, and delvers raised in other conditions can reach heights of 1.7m (5' 7"). The bodies of delvers are relatviely streamlined which aids their digging. They have no ears and their noses don't protrude much.

Heights don't significantly differ across the sexes, and young delvers all look very similar, but female adults have larger hips and legs. This generally makes them faster runners but slower crawlers. Male adults generally develop larger arms and shoulders.

## Life Cycle & Health
Delvers live for an average of 100 years *(roughly 40 Earth-years)*. The shortness is mostly due to a lack of nutritional intake in their early years, and some delvers who have left their underground lives find themselves living longer.

## Calendar
Living underground, Delvers have fallen out of sync with the [[Calendar#Days|day-night cycle]] of [[Mir]]. Their sleep-cycle is slightly longer than the day, which results in minor adjustment problems when Delvers leave their caves and live above ground.

## Societies
Delvers have no expectations of privacy. They have incredible hearing and their tunnels by necessity have few-to-no blockages such as doors.

### Games
%% Game like hide-and-seek, but the delver that's 'it' has to cover themself with a woven branch/vine thing with dried leaves to cover their skin and rustle about so they can't hear. then the other delvers will dig around and the person who's 'it' has to find them. it's called something like my-tunnel your-tunnel, except its name will be Hohrintoh, obvs. %%

### Civilisation
Delvers typically belong to a cave-system group. As such, they have little need to dig, and so only the more traditional, or esoteric characters tend to still dig as a primary mode of getting around underground.

## Tunnels
Almost all delver tunnel systems follow similar patterns. The main entrance tunnel will shortly turn towards running east to west, or north to south, depending on the hill or mountain's position and orientation. There will also be numerous other entrances and exits for access to nearby resources or land, as well as simple escape routes in event of emergencies. 

The main tunnel will have drainage chutes which lead beneath the tunnel system to a large reserviour of water, and a further drainage system in case of flooding. Tunnels branching off the main tunnel will angle upwards for both channelling any water towards the drains, and for any necessary defence against attacks.

Given devlers' lack of privacy, or perhaps feeding into it, the tunnel systems have communal dormitory bedrooms with large beds that several devlers will sleep on at a time.

Delver tunnel systems also have play spaces and classrooms, rooms for storage and food processing, workshops and forges, as well as spaces for growing what few plants will grow underground, or farming subterranean animals.

## External Dealings
Some cave systems will trade with other caves, as well as the other people across Mir.
