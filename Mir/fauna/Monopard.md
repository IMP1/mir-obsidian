# Monopard

## Overview
Monopards are large arboreal mammals. They predominantly idle on branches, until their prey passes by beneath them. This can be smaller arboeal animals on branches below, or any animal smaller than it on the forest floor below. They will drop down and and land with their sharp claws. They have very strong and flexible legs, which allow them to fall from such a height and absorb the impact in the cases when they miss.
