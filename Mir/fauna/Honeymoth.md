## Overview
The honeymoth is a small flying insect. They are known to steal honey from people.

## Life Cycle
The honeymoth lays eggs, from which their larva emerge. This larva then mainly stays near where it hatched and eats, growing bigger. It sheds its skin into a cocoon and emerges as a moth.
When a honeymoth gets nearer the end of its life (about a dozen days), they find somewhere to settle down. They then shed their wings, and grow another cucoon, emerging again into another honeymoth. This cycle can theoretically continue indefinitely.

## Name Etymology
It's unknown whether the name relates to the honey moth's often yellow colour, or whether they are thought to steal honey.
