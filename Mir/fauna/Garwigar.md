#fauna/reptile

## Overview
The Garwigar is a small six-legged reptile, similar in appearance to a spider crossed with a gecko. Garwigars will bask on stone found in arctic regions of [[Rijbak]], from which they obtain their magical energies. These energies both heat the Garwigar, and allow for any excess heat to be used to fire magical missiles to attack their prey. They will then leave the safety of their stone to find their meal.

Garwigars are very vulnerable away from the saftey of the stones which provide them with magic. 

## Behind the Scenes
### Name Etymology
Garwigar comes from the old english name for a spear (Gar) and warrior (Wiga).
