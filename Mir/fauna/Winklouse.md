# Winklouse
#fauna/insect 

## Overview
Winklice, also known as **Blink Bugs**, are large round insects, about a foot long and half that wide. They look similar to an armadillo crossed with a woodlouse.

## Magical Traits
When threatened or startled, winklice will often phase into another plane of existence. People don't understand how they do this, as study of the winklouse is made difficult by this behaviour. 

## Diet
Winklice eat a varied diet of smaller insects, plant roots, and fruits growing near enough to the ground for them to reach.
