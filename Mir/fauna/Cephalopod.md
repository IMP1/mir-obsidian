# Cephalopod

## Overview
Cephalopods live underwater in small nomadic groups. They communicate using bioluminescense.

## Life Cycle & Health

## Ship Attacks
Cephalopods have learnt the mating habits of [[Scuttler|scuttlers]], and will sometimes trigger their reproduction process. They sometimes use this process to distract prey or predators, but have also used a scuttler's explosion in combination with shells or rocks to damage the hull of ships. Land-dwellers have never attributed these acts to cephalopods, either due to not surviving, or the cephalopods being out of sight, under the water, during their "attack". Few land-dwellers have even been able to attribute the damage to scuttlers, but they are aware of waters that they consider dangerous.
