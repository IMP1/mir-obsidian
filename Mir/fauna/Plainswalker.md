# Plainswalker
#fauna/sapient 

## Overview
Plainswalkers live mostly on the world's surface. They have little competition for the colder and hotter regions, and are more tolerant to extreme temperatures, and so live there in higher numbers. They have spread somewhat throughout Mir, but fail to integrate well and so often form their own insular communities.

Many plainswalkers are nomadic, and travel in large insular groups. A few have managed to settle down and integrate well into other cultures.

## Societies
Plainswalkers have historically lived mostly with each other, not mingling very much with other species. In these societies, hard work is praised, and many social norms are rooted in pragmatic fundamentals.

Plainswalker groups are very into efficiency and having the right people doing the jobs they are best suited at. This can sometimes mean being blunt and honest with people about their strengths and weaknesses, which other species can find rude. This can also been mistaken as individualism, but plainswalkers recognise the need for cooperation and will also choose leaders based on their ability to coordinate people, delegate and organise tasks, and keep the group functioning well, rather than their ability to be persuasive or charismatic. They see an optimal group as one that is well-fed, and has time for leisure, despite their being a social norm of scorning idling. Instead, plainswalkers will use their free time for learning, creating art, and other ways of ensuring that everyone is in the best place to perform their duties.

When Plainswalker groups get too big, they split off into smaller offshoots. This is usually a joyous occasion for the "parent" group, and a daunting one, although also exciting, for the "child" group. The splitting of a group can be a difficult logistical challenge to ensure people who have formed attachments stay together, while also ensuring each group can function well. The "child" group will take on a new name, and carry with them a record of the "parent" group, and *their* "parent" group, and so on, creating a line of ancestors back as far as possible. It is seen as a source of pride to both come from a long line, and create many "child" groups, as the former is to be part of a lineage of "effective" and "productive" groups, and the latter is to prove to each other that they too are a "successful" group.

## Life Cycle & Health
Plainswalkers live for an average of 130 years *(roughly 50 Earth-years)*,
assuming they make it out of childhood and into their 40s *(roughly 15)*.

There are a few diseases that plainswalkers are affected by that can be fatal in children, however in the larger towns with healers and herbalists, child mortality is much lower.
