# Plainswalker
#fauna/sapient 

## Overview
Plainswalkers live mostly on the world's surface. They have little competition for the colder and hotter regions, and are more tolerant to extreme temperatures, and so live there in higher numbers. They have spread somewhat throughout Mir, but fail to integrate well and so often form their own insular communities.

Many plainswalkers are nomadic, and travel in large insular groups. A few have managed to settle down and integrate well into other cultures.

## Life Cycle & Health
Plainswalkers live for an average of 130 years *(roughly 50 Earth-years)*,
assuming they make it out of childhood and into their 40s *(roughly 15)*.

There are a few diseases that plainswalkers are affected by that can be fatal in children, however in the larger towns with healers and herbalists, child mortality is much lower.
