# Truorn

## Overview
A large bird, similar to a crow, but without a head to speak of. Instead its body tapers off into just a mouth. Its brain lies with its other internal organs, and it has no eyes, ears or nose. Instead, truorns use a magical sense to find their prey.

## Behind the Scenes
### Name Etymology
Truorn comes from the word true, and the old norse name for an eagle (orn).
