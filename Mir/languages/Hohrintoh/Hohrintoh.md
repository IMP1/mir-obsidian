## Overview
Hohrintoh is the main language of [[Delver|Delvers]].

Its word order is Verb-Object. There are no Subjects. Verbs (and actions) are the focus of the language. The equivalent of “The lazy foxed jumped.” would be something along the lines of “Jumping is what happened to the lazy fox.”, and “He is singing the song”. would be something like “Singing is coming from him, and is resulting in the song.”

Words are vaguely onomatopoeic, which results in them being mainly deep (as sounds underground are deep).

Adverbs precede the verb they affect.

There are various auxilliary words that specify which 'parameters' of a verb are which. These are sometimes omitted for brevity or when it's clear which would be which. Spacial and temporal prepositions are also examples of these auxilliary words.

Common examples of these auxilliary words are *?* (By)

The tense and mood of a verb is determined by its ending. Hohrintoh has two main tenses, past (where the action of a verb has finished) and not-past (where it has either started and not finished, or not yet started). It also has an interrogative mood for asking questions, an imperative mood for giving commands. #TBC/language %% Do we want conditional moods? Or subjunctive moods? How do we want to express complicated tenses like, something will have happened, or something was going to happen? %%
The person and plurality of a verb is determined by the auxilliary words.

TODO: Rethink tenses as having starting and ending points. Those points will be before, after or unknown, relative to an anchor point. That anchor point is usually "now".

Past simple: Start before now. End before now. Single event.
Past continuous: Start before now. End before now. Long event.
Past perfect: Start before anchor before now. End before anchor before now. Single event. (past simple, but relative to a anchor in the past)
Past perfect continuous: Start before anchor before now. End before anchor before now. Long event. (past continuous, but relative to a anchor in the past)

Present simple: Happening now. Starting now or very recently. Ending now or very soon. Single event.
Present continuous: Started in the past, not yet ended (and so I guess ending in the future)
Present perfect: Started before anchor in the present. Ending after anchor in the present.
Present perfect continuous: Same as present perfect. 

Future simple: Start after now. End after now. Single event.
Future continuous: Start after now. End after now. Long event.
Future perfect: Start before anchor in the future. End before anchor in the future. Single event.
Future perfect continuous: Start befote anchor in the future. End before anchor in the future. Long event.

The future simple tense ('it will burn' rather than 'it will be burning') is the same as the present continuous ('it is burning'), which related to the Delver idea that an undertaking to perform an action is equivilent to it beginning.
  
Questions take the form of an inquisitive verb. To ask the question “who has the axe?”, you would ask instead “having?(whom?, the axe)”. Or “Where did you get that water?” would become “get(you, that water, where?)”.
