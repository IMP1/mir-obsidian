# Frostberry

## Overview
The frostberry plant grows year-round in temperate regions. It produces bright blue berries throughout the winter, which gives the plant its name.

When eaten, the plant can give ice burns to the insides of animals.

It is used by some to cool spaces for certain rituals or ceremonies, or to refrigerate food and drink.
