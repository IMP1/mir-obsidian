# Axbane

## Overview
The axbane is an evergreen tree with bark that, as it ages, gets harder and harder. This can make it difficult to remove, and often mature axbanes will be left, with local superstitions believing they sent by the gods and are not meant to be removed. This can mean roads will be routed around them. 

The removal of a mature axbane will usually involve the work of a magician, and given the utility of magic, this is often seen as a low-priority job.
