# Greycap

## Overview
The greycap mushroom grows abundantly in parts of the [[Wetlands]] and, when eaten raw, can give the diner glimpses into the abyss. This is obviously not to everyone's taste, but some aspiring mages (or curious travellers) will travel great distances to try it, hoping to enhance their powers or release something within themselves.
