# Clarity

## Overview
Clarity is a religion found mostly in southern [[Ridgeback]], particularly [[Sand Flats|the Sand Flats]].

Clarity's goal is to find the truth offered by the material world.
It rejects the powers that originate in [[Magic#The Abyss|the Abyss]] and those who use those powers.

It believes that the physical, material, world offers the only truth, and see magic as dangerous and false.

It is most prominant in the Sand Flats, where there are few Midnighters, who would obviously find this religious antithetical to their being. Clarity is not inherently anti-midnighter, but there are some temples and groups for whom the two are heavily intertwined.

Its temples are often ornate, and craftsmanship is highly valued, with embroidery and metalwork proudly displayed.
