# The Worshippers of Darkness

## Overview
The Worshippers of Darkness believe in the unnamed God, and worship darkness and ignorance, as only through darkness and ignorance can there be room for light and knowledge. They originate from, and still mostly reside on The Northern Sister.

They have a high priest, who is reborn. When the old high priest dies, the worshippers go in search for a baby born on the same day.

Only men may join, and they must also be celibate.

## Tenets & Beliefs
  - We are all shadows of the old unnamed gods.
  - Only in shadow can there be light.
  - Only through ignorance can we ever learn.
  - Knowledge comes from the old unnamed gods.

## Rituals
On the the first new moon after midsummer, the Worshippers of Darkness observe what they call 'The New Day'. They gather in an inwards-facing circle as dusk approaches.
